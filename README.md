Additional features list

   GUI
   
      Since version 2.0 NPlusMiner has a GUI making it easy to configure and run.
	  Relies on config files. No need to edit bat files. Simply run NPlusMiner
	  Set the config on the config tab, save, close, run
	  For console lovers. Run NPlusMiner-ConsoleUp.
 
   Pause mining
   
      Ability to pause miners while keeping other jobs running (pause button)
      This will stop mining activity
      BrainPlus will still run in the background avoiding the learning phase on resume
      EarningTracker will still run in the background avoiding the learning phase on resume  
      
   prerun
   
      Ability to run a batch prior switching to a specific algo.
      For example, can be used to set per algo OC via nvidiaInspector
      Simply create a file named <AlgoName>.bat in prerun folder
      If <AlgoName>.bat does not exist, will try to launch prerun/default.bat
      Use overclock with caution

   Per pools config (Advanced)
   
        - **This is for advanced users. Do not use if you do not know what you are doing.**
        - You can now set specific options per pool. For example, you can mine NiceHash on the internal wallet and other pools on a valid wallet. This configuration is provided as an example in Config\PoolsConfig-NHInternal.json
          - Available options
            - Wallet = your wallet address
            - UserName = your MPH user name
            - WorkerName = your worker name
            - PricePenaltyFactor = See explanation below
          - Usage
            - The file Config\PoolsConfig.json contains per pool configuration details. If a pool is listed in this file,
	    the specific settings will be taken into account. If not, the setting for the entry name default will be used.
	    **Do not delete the default entry.**
            - Edit Config\PoolsConfig.json
            - Add an entry for the pool you want to customize
              - The name must be the NPlusMiner name for the pool. ie. for ahashpool, if you use Plus. The name is ahashpoolplus.
              - (**careful with json formating ;)**)
              - Best way is to duplicate the default entry
        - Note that the GUI only updates the default entry. Any other changes need to be done manualy

   PricePenaltyFactor

        - When using advanced per pool configuration, it is possible to add a penalty factor for a specific pool. This simply adds as a multiplicator on estimations presented by the pool.
        - Example scenario
          - NiceHash as a 4% fee - Set PricePenaltyFactor to 0.96 (1-0.04)
          - You feel like a pool is exaggerating his estimations by 10% - Set PricePenaltyFactor to 0.9

   ahashpoolplus / zergpoolplus / zpoolplus / blazepoolplus
   
      Uses calculations based on 24hractual and currentestimate ahashpool prices to get more realistic estimate.
      Includes some trust index based on past 1hr currentestimate variation from 24hr.
      AND is NOT sensible to spikes.
      This shows less switching than following Current Estimate and more switching that following the 24hr Actual.
      Better profitability.

   Earnings Tracking
   
      Displays BTC/H and BTC/D as well a estimation of when the pool payment threshold will be reached.
      Supported pools:
            ahashpool
            zergpool
            zpool
            nicehash
            miningpoolhub (partial)
      If mining more that one pools, shows stats for any supported pool
      Press key e in the console window to show/hide earnings

   Support running multiple instances
   
      **Experimental**
      More than one instance of NPlusMiner can run on the same rig
      Each instance must be placed in it's own directory
      Miner has to be started prior the launch of the next instance

   Optional miners (Advanced)
   
      Some miners are not enabled by default in NPlusMiner for a variety of reasons
      A new folder can be found called "OptionalMiners" containing .ps1 files for some miners
      For advanced users, refer to OptionalMiners\Readme.txt on how to use
      
   Algo switching log
   
      Simple algo switching log in csv switching.log file found in Logs folder.
      You can easily track switching rate.

   Pools variants

      24hr - uses last 24hour Actual API too request profit
         -Low switching rate
      plus - uses advanced calculations to maximize profit
         -Best switching rate
      normal - uses current estimate API too request profit
         -High switching rate

   Console Display Options
   
      Use -UIStyle Light or -UIStyle Full in config.json
            Full = Usual display (Default)
            Light = Show only currently mining info
      UIStyle automaticaly swtiches to Full during benchmarking.

   In session console display toggle
   
      Press key s in the window to switch between light and full display
      Press key e in the window to show/hide earnings 
      Will toggle display at next refresh

   New version notification
   
      NPlusMiner will notify new version availability

If you have Windows 7, 8, or 8.1, please update PowerShell:

CCMiner may need 'MSVCR120.dll' if you don't already have it:
https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/download/details.aspx?id=40784

CCMiner may need 'VCRUNTIME140.DLL' if you don't already have it:
https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48145

running multiple cards its recommended to increase Virtual Memory 64gb is optimal

Requires nvidia driver newer than 388

Made For & Tested with 6x10603gb 6x1070 6x1070ti 6x1080ti (users have reported up to 12cards working have not tested myself)
Some miners do not support more that 9 cards
