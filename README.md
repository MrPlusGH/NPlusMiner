	 Monitoring

*****

Easy configuration, easy start in two steps:

      Run NPLusMiner

      1. Enter your BTC address
      2. Hit "Start"
Fee:

      There is a 8 minutes per day fee (0.5%), that can be changed in the config (Minimum is 3 - 0.2%)
      When less than 3 minutes is set, lottery is 0 or any walue between 3 and 8

*****

## Features list

   GUI
   
      Since version 2.0 NPlusMiner has a GUI making it easy to configure and run.
      Relies on config files. No need to edit bat files. Simply run NPlusMiner 
      Set your wallet address and hit start
      For console lovers. Run NPlusMiner-ConsoleUp.
 
   AutoUpdate
   
      Since version 4.0 NPlusMiner integrates an AutoUpdate feature.
      
   Auto Ban miners
   
        There are cases where some miners might fail in some systems.
        I such cases, NPlusMiner will ignore this miner after a count of failure.
        Default value for max failure is 3 and can be changes in Config.json.
        "MaxMinerFailure":  3 - set to 0 to deactivate autoban.
        Bans are only valid for a session. NPlusMiner will retry the miner on restart.
		
   Pause Mining
   
        Ability to pause miners while keeping other jobs running (pause button)
        This will stop mining activity
        BrainPlus will still run in the background avoiding the learning phase on resume
        EarningTracker will still run in the background avoiding the learning phase on resume

   prerun
   
      Ability to run a batch prior switching to a specific algo.
      For example, can be used to set per algo OC via nvidiaInspector
      Simply create a file named <AlgoName>.bat in prerun folder
      If <AlgoName>.bat does not exist, will try to launch prerun/default.bat
      Use overclock with caution

   Per pools config (Advanced)
   
        - **This is for advanced users. Do not use if you do not know what you are doing.**
        - You can now set specific options per pool. For example, you can mine NiceHash on the internal wallet and other pools on a valid wallet. This configuration is provided as an example in Config\PoolsConfig-NHInternal.json
          - Available options
            - Wallet = your wallet address
            - UserName = your MPH user name
            - WorkerName = your worker name
            - PricePenaltyFactor = See explanation below
	    - Algorithm = List of included or excluded Aglo on pool (see example files)

          - Usage
            - The file Config\PoolsConfig.json contains per pool configuration details. If a pool is listed in this file,
	    the specific settings will be taken into account. If not, the setting for the entry name default will be used.
	    **Do not delete the default entry.**
            - Edit Config\PoolsConfig.json
            - Add an entry for the pool you want to customize
              - The name must be the NPlusMiner name for the pool. ie. for ahashpool, if you use Plus. The name is ahashpoolplus.
              - (**careful with json formating ;)**)
              - Best way is to duplicate the default entry
        - Note that the GUI only updates the default entry. Any other changes need to be done manualy

   PricePenaltyFactor (Advanced)

        - When using advanced per pool configuration, it is possible to add a penalty factor for a specific pool. This simply adds as a multiplicator on estimations presented by the pool.
        - Example scenario
          - NiceHash as a 4% fee - Set PricePenaltyFactor to 0.96 (1-0.04)
          - You feel like a pool is exaggerating his estimations by 10% - Set PricePenaltyFactor to 0.9

   BrainPlus - ahashpoolplus / zergpoolplus / zpoolplus / blazepoolplus / BlockMastersPlus / PhiPhiPoolPlus / StarPoolPlus / HashRefineryPlus
   
      Uses calculations based on 24hractual and currentestimate ahashpool prices to get more realistic estimate.
      Includes some trust index based on past 1hr currentestimate variation from 24hr.
      AND is NOT sensible to spikes.
      This shows less switching than following Current Estimate and more switching that following the 24hr Actual.
      Better profitability.

   Pools variants

      24hr - uses last 24hour Actual API too request profit
         -Low switching rate
      plus - uses advanced calculations to maximize profit
         -**Best switching rate**
      normal - uses current estimate API too request profit
         -High switching rate
	 
   Developers and Contributors fee distribution

      There is a 8 minutes per day fee (0.5%), that can be changed in the config (Minimum is 3 - 0.2%)
      When less than 3 minutes is set, lottery is 0 or any walue between 3 and 8
      
      We use a fair fee distribution to developers and contributors. Fees are dirtibuted randomly
      to a public list of devs which can be found here: http://tiny.cc/r355qy
      
      We want to stay completely transparent on the way donations are managed in the product.
      Donations occurs once every 24 hours for the selected amount of time (default 8 minutes).
      The first donation sequence occurs 1 hour after miners are started.
      If Interval is set higher than the donation time, the interval will prime.
      Example for default parameters:
      Miners started at 10, First donation cycle runs at 10:52 untill 11, Next donation cycle occurs 24 hours after.
      All donation time and addresses are recorded in the logs folder.

   Miners Monitoring

      Keep tabs on all your mining rigs from one place
      **Thanks to @NemosMiner for giving is aggreement to share the NemosMiner monitoring servers.**
      You can now optionally monitor all your workers remotely, both in the GUI and via https://nemosminer.com  
      Monitoring setup instructions https://nemosminer.com/setup.php
      
      NPlusMiner does not send any personnal informations to servers. Only miner related info are collected as miner names and hashrates. Miners path are all expressed relative so we have no risk to send any personnal informations like username.

   Algo selection

      Users might use the Algo list in config to Include or Exclude algos.
      The list simply works with a +/- system.

      +algo for algo selection
      -algo for algo removal

      If "+" Used, all selected algo have to be listed
      If "Minus" Used, all algo selected but exluded ones.

      Do not combine + and - for the same algo

      Examples: 
      Mine anything but x16r:			Algo list = -x16r
      Mine anything but x16r and bcd:		Algo list = -x16r,-bcd
      Mine only x16r:				Algo list = +x16r
      Mine only x16r and BCD:			Algo list = +x16r,+bcd
      Mine any available algo at pool:		Algo list = <blank>

   Earnings Tracking
   
      Graphical displays BTC/H and BTC/D as well a estimation of when the pool payment threshold will be reached.
      Supported pools:
            ahashpool
            zergpool
            zpool
            nicehash
            miningpoolhub (partial)
            Blazepool
            BlockMasters
            PhiPhipool
            Starpool
            HashRefinery
      If mining more that one pools, shows stats for any supported pool
      Press key e in the console window to show/hide earnings

   Support running multiple instances
   
      **Experimental**
      More than one instance of NPlusMiner can run on the same rig
      Each instance must be placed in it's own directory
      Miner has to be started prior the launch of the next instance
      
   Optional miners (Advanced)
   
      Some miners are not enabled by default in NPlusMiner for a variety of reasons
      A new folder can be found called "OptionalMiners" containing .ps1 files for some miners
      For advanced users, refer to OptionalMiners\Readme.txt on how to use

   Algo switching log
   
      Simple algo switching log in csv switching.log file found in Logs folder.
      You can easily track switching rate.

   Console Display Options
   
      Use -UIStyle Light or -UIStyle Full in config.json
            Full = Usual display
            Light = Show only currently mining info (Default)
      UIStyle automaticaly swtiches to Full during benchmarking.

   In session console display toggle
   
      Press key s in the window to switch between light and full display
      Press key e in the window to show/hide earnings 
      Will toggle display at next refresh

https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/download/details.aspx?id=40784

CCMiner may need 'VCRUNTIME140.DLL' if you don't already have it:
https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48145

running multiple cards its recommended to increase Virtual Memory 64gb is optimal

Requires Nvidia driver 416.34 or newer / 417.35 recommended 
http://us.download.nvidia.com/Windows/417.35/417.35-desktop-win10-64bit-international-whql.exe

Made For & Tested with 8x10603gb 6x1070 6x1070ti 6x1080ti (users have reported up to 12cards working have not tested myself) Some miners do not support more that 9 cards
